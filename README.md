Client/Server Development

1)How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I think that keeping it simple is the best policy, especially with how fast the program I'm in is moving along for me. Anyway, the best way to manage connecting milestones and integrating code is to keep everything simple and uniform, luckily the weekly videos and starter codes provided a lot of framework to work off of.

2)How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I think in terms of OOP concepts a lot of the time, which was not so helpful this time around but wasn't totally useless. I was floundering on a few of the requirements for the dashboard when it came to the actual output but I felt confident in my attempts to categorize the animals according to the requirements. I think the thought process and approach were very similar to other courses as stated previously but I was having trouble pivoting to dashboard organization. I would defenitely play around with the concepts more and earlier on.

3)What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists bridge the gap between man and machine, or man and machine control and machine in my experience. It matters because there are complicated concepts that need to be handled clinically, and unless that is an employees express purpose, it can be too much work. It could mean the difference between life and death, as the company recruits and trains rescue animals, organizing that effort plays a large role in the actual rescue efforts.
